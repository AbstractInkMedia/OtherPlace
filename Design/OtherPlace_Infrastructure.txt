	[ Game Systems ]
	
	Game Systems Manager:
		• Responsible for calling all other Game Systems in the proper order.
		• Influences Game Systems State, which is called by other systems to request
			changes to the Game State. Only Game Systems Manager is allowed
			to tell the Game Systems State to change over to the next state.
		• On a new frame, Game Systems Manager takes in the current Game State
			and acts accordingly.
	
	Game Systems State:
		• Called by other systems to request changes to the current game state.
		• On a new frame, Game Systems Manager tells the Game Systems State to
			update based on the last frame's events.
	
	Game Systems Map Generator:
		• Responsible for generating the game environment when called by
			the Game Systems Manager.
		• Similarly responsible for deconstructing the game environment when called
			by the Game Systems Manager.

	Game Systems Agent Handler:
		• Responsible for handling Agents and making calls to Game Systems Manager
			via Events.
		• Runs before Game Systems Player, so that agents will react to the
			Player Character's current state, giving the Player a 1-frame
			advantage. Essentially, the Agents react to the Player,
			rather than the Player reacting to the Agents.

	Game Systems Player:
		• Responsible for handling Player input, some of which will be used to
			manipulate the associated Game Character Player, and others which will
			call Game Systems Manager via Events.
		• As above, runs after Game Systems Agent Handler so that the Agents
			react to the Player. For example, if the Player Character moves,
			the Agent will have 1-frame where they still consider the initial
			position the Player Character was standing in; if the Player Character
			were to instead move before before the Agent Handler, then the
			Agents would instantly react.



	[ Agents ]

	Agent:
		• Base Class used by all other Agents.
	
	Agent Character:
		• Inherits from Agent, with additional features for influencing an
			in-game Character.
